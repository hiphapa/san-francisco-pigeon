You've decided to look for crumbs. Good for you. 

You walk down O'Farrell Street, pecking at whatever attracts your interest.

You find a few Cheetos and an only-slightly-hard piece of roll.

It'll do. Now you're thirsty. 

You see a big puddle, but it's pretty close to traffic. 

The cabs aren't careful about hitting people, much less pigeons.

Do you drink from the puddle, bathe in it, or keep on walking hoping for a better water source?
