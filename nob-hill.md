Ooh, look at you, heading up Nob Hill!

You walk up to Post Street, and you find a huge piece of $4 toast. Hooray!

You eat the whole thing and then feel slightly guilty about it.

You decide to walk it off--gotta stay fit!--and hike all the way up to Grace Cathedral.

When you get to the cathedral, you feel transformed. It's peaceful, it's quiet, and clean.

Hopping up the stairs you see the most beautiful bird you've ever seen. 

He's green and red and squawks really, really loudly. Just your type. 

Do you go talk to him, or watch him creepily from a distance?
