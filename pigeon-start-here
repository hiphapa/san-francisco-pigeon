Congratulations. You are now a pigeon

You wake up on the dirty, smelly sidewalks of San Francisco's Tenderloin neighborhood. It's afternoon.

Your head hurts, your feathers are wet, and you're hungry. 

Do you stumble down the sidewalk to see if there's any crumbs or head up Nob Hill for fancier grub?
