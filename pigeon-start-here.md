Congratulations. You are now a pigeon. But you have both your feet, so there's that.

You wake up on the dirty, smelly sidewalks of San Francisco's Tenderloin neighborhood. It's afternoon.

Your head hurts, your feathers are wet, and you're hungry. 

Do you stumble down the sidewalk to [see if there's any crumbs](https://github.com/hiphapa/san-francisco-pigeon/blob/master/look-for-crumbs.md) or [head up Nob Hill](https://github.com/hiphapa/san-francisco-pigeon/blob/master/nob-hill.md) for fancier grub?
