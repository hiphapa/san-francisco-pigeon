You shuffle up to that gorgeous bright bird a little nervously.

"Wow, love the plumage... you peck around here often?"

You berate yourself for your hopeless unoriginality. That is probably the worst pick-up line ever.

Luckily, the parrot doesn't seem to notice. He begins talking about himself: where he flies, who he flies with.

He seems to hang with a very upwardly-mobile crowd. They live in Telegraph Hill!

They have humans feed them... every day! He asks if you'd like to see his nest.

Do you fly with him to see his nest, or say something alluring non-commital?
