You shuffle up to that gorgeous bright bird a little nervously.

"Wow, love the plumage... you peck around here often?"

You berate yourself for your hopeless unoriginality. That is probably the worst pick-up line EVER.

Luckily, the parrot doesn't seem to care. He eagerly begins talking about himself: where he flies, who he flies with.
One of his friends is a blue macaw.

He seems to hang with a very upwardly-mobile crowd. They live in Telegraph Hill on orange trees.

They have humans feed them... on purpose. He asks if you'd like to see his nest.

Do you fly with him to see his nest, or say something alluring non-commital?
